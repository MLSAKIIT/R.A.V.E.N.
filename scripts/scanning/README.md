# Scanning

This folder contains scripts related to **scanning**.

Scripts designed to scan systems or services for open ports, vulnerabilities, and security issues.

### Suggestions for contributors
- Create a script to perform basic TCP and UDP port scans
- Build a scanner for common web vulnerabilities like directory traversal
- Develop a script to check SSL/TLS configurations
- Write a vulnerability check for outdated server banners

Use the scripts responsibly and only in environments you are authorized to test.
