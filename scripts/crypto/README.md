# üîê Crypto

Scripts related to cryptography, hashing, and encoding/decoding.

## What Goes Here
Anything that deals with encrypting, decrypting, hashing, or encoding data. Scripts can be helpers for CTFs, password recovery, or crypto challenges.

## Example Implementations
- Hash generators (`MD5`, `SHA1`, `SHA256`, `bcrypt`)
- Hash crackers (dictionary/brute force)
- Encoding/decoding (`Base64`, `Hex`, `ROT13`, `JWT`)
- Simple cipher tools (Caesar, Vigen√®re, XOR)
- File encryption/decryption with `AES` or `RSA`
