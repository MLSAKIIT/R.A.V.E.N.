# Enumeration

This folder contains scripts related to **enumeration**.

Scripts here are focused on gathering information such as subdomain enumeration and host discovery.

### Suggestions for contributors
- Create a script to brute force subdomains using a wordlist
- Add a service discovery tool that checks common ports
- Build a module to enumerate DNS records (MX, TXT, CNAME)
- Write a banner-grabbing script for open ports

Use the scripts responsibly and only in environments you are authorized to test.
