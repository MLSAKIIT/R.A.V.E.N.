# Payloads

This folder contains scripts related to **payloads**.

Scripts and resources for generating or testing payloads in a controlled and authorized environment.

### Suggestions for contributors
- Add a script that generates test payloads for XSS
- Write a tool to encode payloads in base64 or URL format
- Create a script to simulate SQL injection payload testing
- Develop payload templates that can be extended for fuzzing

Use the scripts responsibly and only in environments you are authorized to test.
